Context
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parus is a stack based symbolic programming language, devised around the new Hebrew year's eve of 5781 (september 2020).
The following document defines the language, however it does not define any specific implementation of the language.
Neither is this document suited as a learning material for the language.
The language is named after Paridae bird family (Tits, Titmice and Chickadees).
Members of the Paridae family exhibit high intelligance, high adaptability and small size (much like the language itself).


Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The word push refers to pushing data onto stack.
The word pull refers to pulling data out of the stack.

The expression "Nth index" or "index" refers to a position in the stack, counting from the top of the stack.
For example index 0 refers the most recently pushed item, etc.


Evaluation process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The evaluator can be expressed as this psudo-program:

	self defining? -> push self

		self defining values are values, that define themselves such as:
		operators, numbers, strings etc ...

	quoted? -> push quoted
		
		a quoted expression is any expression that is prefixed with a ' character.

	symbol? -> get from lexicon the binding of the symbol and apply it:
		
		a symbol is any valid expression which is not self defining or quoted.

		* assuming that such a binding exists
		* invald symbols: ', ;, (, )


	Comments are marked by a semicolon (;) and they span until the end of the line.

In order to evaluate a Parus expression both a stack and a lexicon are required.

The stack represent the program's memory, it is a last in first out data structure.

The lexicon represent the program's environment.
It may be implementated as either non scoping, lexical scoping, or dynamic scoping environment,
this manual doesn't favour any particular name resolution method.

Invalid Expressions:
	-Unterminated or uninitiated parentheses.
	-A standalone Quote form (', '', ''', ...)

If invalid expression is given an error is signaled.

Examples for valid expressions
-----------------------------
'Symbol 
''QSym
1
(1 2 (+) !) !
(dpl *) '^2 define ; 3 expressions ( dpl * ), '^2, define

Examples for invalid expressions
--------------------------------
( ) ) 		; uninitiated
( ( ) 		; unterminated
' 			; invalid quote form
('') 		; invalid quote form
''' 		; invalid quote form


Datatypes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parus requires the following datatypes:
	- Operators - Both base operators and user defined operators
	- Symbols
	- Quoted values
	- Numeric value (either integers or floating points or both)

* linguistically there is not difference between base operators and user defined operators.

Parus may optionally support any other datatype such as:
	- Complex numbers
	- Rational numbers
	- Strings
	- Arrays
	- Files
	... etc


Base Operators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ value symbol ] define
Defines a new entry on the lexicon.

[ symbol ] delete
Deletes the most recent entry from the lexicon.

[ top-of-the-stack ] !
Also known as "apply top" or simply "apply", Passes the top of the stack to the apply function.

* ON SOME (BUT NOT ALL) program languages, 
the apply function will have to provide a "back door" for this base operator, 
because if the base operator ! calls the apply function, 
and the apply function will try to apply the symbol ! it will cause mutual recursion between the two processes.

[ value ] quotate
Quotates the top item of the stack.

[ condition true false ] if
If condition is a non zero value then, remove false else, remove true from the stack.

[ a b ] eqv?
Push a non 0 value if a and b are equivalent 0 if not.

[ index ] @
Also known as "fetch",
brings the item from the Nth index to the top of the stack, and removes the original.

[ index ] @.
Also known as "fetch copy",
brings a copy of the item from the Nth index to the top of the stack, without removing the original.

length
Push the size of the stack (not including LEN's result).

[ item ] drop
Drops the top of the stack

[ value ] find
Push the index of the most recent equivalent value.
* Important the index given is before the parameter value is given or the result returned
Example:
4 3 'a 1 0 'a find --> 4 3 'a 1 0 2
If the symbol is not present return -1

Arithmetic operations:

[ a b ] + 	==> push a + b
[ a b ] - 	==> push a - b
[ a b ] * 	==> push a * b
[ a b ] / 	==> push a / b if b is 0 then a warning is displayed and an undefined value is pushed
[ a b ] = 	==> push 0 if not (a = b), a non zero value if a = b 
[ a b ] < 	==> push 0 if not (a < b), a non zero value if a < b
[ a b ] > 	==> push 0 if not (a > b), a non zero value if a > b

Any datatype included in the implementation, has to have a operator that returns if the top of the stack is of that datatype.

For example:

[ item ] integer? 
push a non 0 zero value if item is an integer else push 0.

[ item ] operator?
push a non 0 zero value if item is a operator (either a base or user defined operator) else push 0.

[ item ] symbol?
push a non 0 zero value if item is a symbol else push 0.

[ item ] quoted?
push a non 0 zero value if item is quoted else push 0.

Any other base operator may be included with a Parus implementation. these operators should not remove the top.

It is also recommended to include a common opterator, Such as:
[ symbol min max cmp inc fn ] for
case [ c1 e1 c2 e2 ... ] end-case
[ item ] dpl
 ... etc

Although these operators could also be expressed in Parus.

Recursion and Iteration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any iterative construct in Parus is represented by a recursive construct.

For Example consider:

(A) 'A define A 

If no optimization was present in the implementation the following expression will result in overflow of the call stack,
However this example is iterative (even though it has no result),
So theoretically this process should run an infinite amount of times without overflowing the call stack.

In order to solve this problem the following optimization can be applied:

The last call of any operator should run in the same call as the calling operator.

This derives from the observation that once the last call has ended, the calling operator itself has ended,
Thus there is no operator to return to, so it won't effect the computation if both operator would share the same call.

The following operator cannot be optimized:

(A 1 +) 'A define A

Sense the call to A is not the last instruction in the operator, and the process will cause a call stack overflow eventually.

If the number of calls exceeds a preset value then an error is signaled.

Note that these examples are also iterative:

'A 'A define A

('A !) 'A define A

((A) !) 'A define A

(('A !) !) 'A define A

(B) 'A define
(A) 'B define A

Errors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the following circumstances an error is signaled:
- When an invalid expression given
- When the stack has overflowed
- When the stack has underflowed
- When an entry cannot be defined 
	(for example when lexicon's memory has overflowed)
- When programs attempt to delete an undefined entry
- When programs attempt to retrieve an undefined entry
- When there is insufficient memory to complete the computation 
	(for example when the maximal call depths has been reached)

Base operators which fail to execute successfully may also signal an error.


Appendix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The principles of the Parus language could be illustrated by the following simple Lisp functions:

(define parus-apply (lambda (value stk lex)
		(cond
			((base-operator? value)	(value stk lex))
			((user-operator? value)	(operator-eval value stk lex))
			(else 					(parus-eval value stk lex)))))

(define parus-eval (lambda (expr stk lex)
	(cond
		((self? expr) 	((stk 'push) expr))
		((quoted? expr)	((stk 'push) (quotate expr)))
		((symbol? expr)	(parus-apply ((lex 'get) expr) stk lex))

		(else (display "invalid expression given")))))
